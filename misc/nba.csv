2024-06-07 07:46:10,It's been a long week without basketball
2024-06-07 08:13:14,ESPN: How does this Mavs Celtics series affect Lebrons legacy!?!?
2024-06-07 08:17:39,ESPN is just a shamelessly terrible product. Damn.
2024-06-07 07:56:32,IT IS THE FUCKING NBA FINALS WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE LAKERS AHHHHHHHH
2024-06-07 09:43:26,"Oh my lord. I know im beating a dead horse but HOLY SHIT the espn halftime show is a racket.


""ANNND we're back! Wow Kristaps przingus made some shots. Insane! Now back to our sponsors!""


It's not even funny anymore. Just sad."
2024-06-07 08:11:54,This pregame is why people don‚Äôt like the Lakers smh
2024-06-07 09:04:27,SHOCKING that the team that kicked everyone's ass for eight months is actually really good.
2024-06-07 07:57:35,ESPN who hates both the Celtics and the Mavs have to resort to fucking Lakers talk in the finals lmfaooo
2024-06-07 08:38:19,God the shameless 180 on gambling is sickening. These ad's are trying to make it sound hip for teens too...
2024-06-07 09:16:35,Celtics made it to the finals missing their best player the whole time
2024-06-07 09:42:47,"Here‚Äôs a question, what team right now could guard the Celtics. Their starting 5 is all all star caliber players. The anti Celtics circlejerk has been insane this week.

This Celtics team is fucking crazy man"
2024-06-07 10:39:57,Jrue is the most over qualified 4th/5th man in the NBA. Boston getting him for what they did was an absolute steal.
2024-06-07 09:05:38,"Conspiracy Theory: Porzingis was never actually hurt, the Celtics load managed him the first 3 rounds so he'd be fresh and healthy for the Finals and so Dallas would have less tape on him. Joe Mazzula is an evil genius."

2024-06-07 09:40:31,"This desk is so bad compared to TNT‚Äîeven with TNT having Draymond lol

2024-06-07 08:36:58,ESPN having their own sports book is so unethical lol.
2024-06-07 09:46:30,Joe Biden would sweep the election if he ran in a platform of taking the NBA away from ESPN
2024-06-07 11:13:20,There‚Äôs really just NO postgame show after a finals game?? That seems so weird. I‚Äôm not even the kind of guy that watches sportscenter or sport discussion shows in general (aside from inside the nba) but it‚Äôd be nice to continue sitting on my couch and wind down while watching some highlights and light discussion
2024-06-07 11:15:28,"Damn, Kyrie is 0-11 against Celtics since he left."
2024-06-07 11:20:21,In honor of the Celtics win I‚Äôm going to drink a lone bottle of Sam Adams that‚Äôs been sitting in the back of my fridge since Halloween
2024-06-07 09:04:06,"Mavericks are playing insanely stupid. Taking dumb shots almost every possession, sprinting directly into bigs and pulling shots with no moves, switching guards onto Porzingis every opportunity, just overall so stupid"
2024-06-07 09:06:41,"The game isn't over, but can the rest of the NBA fandom stop pretending that the Celtics with KP are not an entirely different animal?

The dude was playing like an all NBA center this season. Games played is the only thing keeping him from making the all star team and getting all NBA votes"
2024-06-07 08:59:07,Man Celtics are just a completely different type of monster when KP is out there
2024-06-07 09:05:53,I am just soaking this in because this may be the best I ever feel about basketball
2024-06-07 09:16:43,Lmao...you just have to laugh. Prozingis is ridiculous. Too good.
2024-06-07 09:18:09,Imagine KP and Doncic playing together
2024-06-07 09:43:52,What in the actual FUCK was this halftime?!!!!? It was literally just commercials
2024-06-07 09:45:11,"Wait, did they just bring in Josh Hart to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt allow good shots, get more good shots‚Äù and go back to ads?"
2024-06-07 09:46:57,Espn had the fucking gall to put a 30 second halftime show during my regularly scheduled halftime commercials. What the fuck
2024-06-07 10:20:39,Can‚Äôt believe we have Doris instead of Jeff van gundy man all time downgrade
2024-06-07 10:21:19,JJ and doris have negative chemistry.
2024-06-07 10:31:30,Its fucking insane when Jrue holiday and derick white are your 4th and 5th best players. How do you even build a team like that
2024-06-07 10:59:12,Bad day for Celtics haters
2024-06-07 09:19:06,I cannot WAIT for halftime to get some updates on the Lakers coaching hire
2024-06-07 09:27:16,"Refs: Here just have some points.

2024-06-07 08:10:50,ESPN is the worst

2024-06-07 09:27:53,THE EARTH IS ROUND BITCHES
2024-06-07 09:41:44,Are you fucking serious? They spoke for 30 seconds and went to commercial.
2024-06-07 09:41:46,"Man I wish TNT had the finals, ESPN is a joke"
2024-06-07 09:44:07,"45 seconds of ""analysis"" sandwiched between 8 minutes of ads"
2024-06-07 09:45:00,Fuck I just wish TNT had the finals this show is ass
2024-06-07 09:47:01,I'm actually convinced this basketball game isn't coming back. Just ads.
2024-06-07 10:21:08,Mavs getting blown out twice in 1 game
2024-06-07 10:21:24,"Doris really says the weirdest shit, it's very jarring"
2024-06-07 10:30:57,What a brutal game from the Mavs supporting cast. Just absolute dog shit everywhere other than Luka.
2024-06-07 10:31:22,"- Porzingis, White, Jrue, Horford

Vs 

- Washington, Lively, DJJ, Gafford

Just not close. Luka and Kyrie are going to have to massively outplay Jaylen and Tatum to have a shot. And that‚Äôs a tall order."
2024-06-07 10:31:58,This Celtics team in the past would have crumbled when Dallas came back. This year is different.
2024-06-07 10:41:55,"3rd option Jrue is good.

2nd option Jrue is terrible.

5th option Jrue is some bullshit."
2024-06-07 10:57:57,How do we go from Chuck and Ernie Freaking Johnson‚Ä¶to Malika Andrews and Perkins
2024-06-07 11:00:09,"A 10 second postgame show for the NBA FINALS. Every time I think ESPN can‚Äôt go any lower, they surprise me. How is Adam Silver OK with this?"
2024-06-07 08:12:52,Finals game between Celtics and Mavericks and they‚Äôre talking about the Lakers lol
2024-06-07 10:57:23,"The salt in this thread is wild lmao it‚Äôs just one game y‚Äôall, still a whole series to go. See y‚Äôall Sunday."
2024-06-07 08:46:39,38 days lol.  The nba playoffs are so fucking long
2024-06-07 10:13:19,"why does ""launching yourself into a center"" mean you are fouled?"
2024-06-07 09:17:12,Was Dallas aware Porzingis was going to play in the series?
2024-06-07 10:12:57," I agree with those 2 travel calls, but like‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs been 25 travels this game. There‚Äôs 30 travels every game I watch. Why call 2 right there right now?"
2024-06-07 10:20:16,Doris is horned up.
2024-06-07 10:39:34,"This is the ideal defensive game for Boston

Mavs role players shut down completely especially the bigs as lob threats

Kyrie very ineffective

Luka still gets his points but can't really find open lanes to get his teammates going

Like the Mavs' box score is pretty much exactly what Boston would look for lol"
2024-06-07 10:39:38,Maybe the Pacers were actually an extremely good team
2024-06-07 10:42:02,The gms who gave jrue holiday and porzingis to the Celtics need to be tarred and feathered
2024-06-07 10:49:06,Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk has scored more points in the finals than Embiid

2024-06-07 09:17:20,Kristaps bouta win Finals MVP before Embiid and neither have played in a CF game
2024-06-07 08:46:56,Kyrie giving that kind of effort on D is huge
2024-06-07 08:52:53,Good God shut up Doris lol
2024-06-07 09:27:05,Tatum with some sloppy passes. I hope these guys keep playing hard. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre up 25 they need to keep scoring and playing D.

2024-06-07 10:51:58,So are we all in agreement that the funniest outcome of this would be a Porzingis Finals MVP?
2024-06-07 10:54:50,That fan just stole Tatums towel lol
2024-06-07 11:10:59,Luka with 30+ and still that big of a loss? Yeesh

2024-06-07 09:27:11,Am I happy the team that owned us is getting wrecked right now or embarrassed that we couldn't do anything close to what the C's are doing right now against this Mavs team
2024-06-07 09:40:52,How the fuck can you justify having the desk talk for thirty seconds and then cutting immediately back to another ad break that's crazy¬†
2024-06-07 09:43:32,"ESPN's halftime show is literally 90% ads.

2024-06-07 10:21:40,Doris Burke boutta have a meeting with HR soon
2024-06-07 10:40:51,Math and skill wise it‚Äôs hard to see boston lose 4 times out of 7. Jrue Holiday is their FIFTH option on offense and now porzingis is their 6th man
2024-06-07 11:19:28,Forgive me father for I am about to Zyn
2024-06-07 11:21:43,Let Luka go 1 on 1 and keep everyone else from scoring. Luka gets his 30 pints but only 1 assist.

2024-06-07 09:43:05,The espn halftime show is a joke. Come back from commercial break for less than a minute. Awful. NBA got handed a fat check for this kind of production
2024-06-07 09:43:43,Qnyone know what year they stopped doing haltime shows and just switched to commercials? The Finals used to feel like a big deal but last few years just feel like a regular season game with glitter on it
2024-06-07 09:44:11,What a halftime show. It's been 15 minutes and only 30 seconds of actual halftime analysis
2024-06-07 09:56:27,Dallas lucky to be only down 16 after that horrific first half for them.
2024-06-07 10:06:35,Luka needs to teach Kyrie how to thrive on getting boo'd

2024-06-07 10:08:27,"Why does Porzingis, the largest player, not simply eat the other players?"
2024-06-07 10:14:30,I just don‚Äôt understand fouls in the NBA.  Everything and nothing is a foul.  I don‚Äôt even know how you play defense lol
2024-06-07 10:20:10,tf was that Dorris?
2024-06-07 10:20:56,I love being a neutral right now. Just enjoying all the bitterness in this comment section.
2024-06-07 11:04:45,Blake Griffin got to be mad he didn't hang out on the bench one more year
2024-06-07 08:46:59,That Kyrie shot was fucking insane
2024-06-07 08:47:10,"""he left home at 13 to play professional basketball""

2024-06-07 10:40:16,god knew that if he gave Jaylen Brown the ability to make free throws he‚Äôd be far too powerful
2024-06-07 08:59:04,I honestly think Boston sweeps if Porzingis stays healthy. People seriously underestimated how important he is to this team's success.
2024-06-07 09:03:59,Kyrie on fraud alert big time
2024-06-07 09:04:54,KP running away with FMVP after a quarter wasn‚Äôt on my bingo card for tonight lmaooooo

2024-06-07 09:14:12,"I know this whole series won‚Äôt go this way, but it‚Äôs so funny watching a team get dominated and then we sub in White, Tatum and Porzingis"
2024-06-07 09:16:37,KP is actually OP in this matchup lol
2024-06-07 09:16:47,If Boston won and KP won FMVP instead of Tatum I‚Äôd be fine with that

2024-06-07 09:39:18,Went to the Mavs thread and read like 10 comments on the lines of hoping KP gets hurt. Yall gotta chill
2024-06-07 09:40:15,"Everybody needs to remember Mavs were blown out against LAC and OKC in games 1 as well. Dallas tends to play shit in g1 under kidd and then adjust. 

Boston is clearly another level of beast but this series isn't over after 2 quarters and their 7'3 center shooting 1000% fg."

2024-06-07 09:46:52,"ESPN halftime show is the worst show in any sport that I can think of. Why even have the personalities there?

2024-06-07 09:56:31,Kyrie needs to open his 3rd eye or something

2024-06-07 10:15:43,"bruh, these fouls when the offensive player just flies into the defender are so annoying"
2024-06-07 10:19:37,Brown‚Äôs better than Tatum.
2024-06-07 10:20:30,wtf doris
2024-06-07 10:20:59,I miss the TNT crew
2024-06-07 10:21:23,Luka goes to the bench and the Mavs look like an AAU travel ball team

2024-06-07 10:33:12,"Our role players just have a way lower floor than Boston‚Äôs. When they‚Äôre having a bad game, they are BAAAAD"
2024-06-07 10:33:39,12 points on 19 shots is nasty stuff from Kyrie. Only 2 guys on the Mavs really take shots and if one of them is shitting his pants it's pretty hard to win.
2024-06-07 10:39:11,Jrue holiday being your 5th option is disgusting
2024-06-07 10:40:14,"That's it. Great game from the Celtics. Good response after the Mavs run. 

Kyrie need to play better. We can't have him shooting this bad. Celtics are a great team for us to have our second star play like that."
2024-06-07 10:40:21,Hopefully everyone on TV and these podcasts will stop talking about Kyrie like he's the best player on this team.
2024-06-07 10:40:40,I‚Äôm gonna have to delete a lot of comments once this series is over
2024-06-07 10:54:12,"Looking at the box score, the Celtics won this game in the 1st Q.

Mavs either just got a big wake-up call and will come out guns blazing next game - or this series is over."
2024-06-07 10:55:41,Fuck. Have to wait until Sunday for a non travel game? Has it always been like that?
2024-06-07 08:47:10,"Thank you Doris Burke for helping me get in touch with the spanish language, I'll see yall on ESPN Deportes"

ESPN can't not talk about the Lakers.

Lmao."
2024-06-07 08:37:06,It's annoying going from the excellence of TNT to the absolute garbage of ESPN. Mike Breen can't salvage ESPN's awful presentation

2024-06-07 09:07:24,Gonna devote my life to working my way up the espn ladder so I can make the executive decision to end these stupid little fake returns from commercial where they talk for a second and then go back to commercial
2024-06-07 09:16:32,KP playing out of his mind. I know the revenge feels sweet as fuck right now

2024-06-07 09:17:04,KP being Finals MVP is something I can stomach.

2024-06-07 10:05:17,If this game is like a 5 point game in the 4th quarter it would be the most average Celtics game ever
2024-06-07 10:06:11,Holy shit they finally call a loose ball foul on Celtics
2024-06-07 10:06:21,wow almost 30 pt lead and 11 pts back.

2024-06-07 10:07:05,"This ""3-or-die"" offense is just so lazy from the Celtics."
2024-06-07 10:07:12,"I love live game lines 

took Dallas at +20.5"
2024-06-07 10:08:06,Second half Luka is nasty.
2024-06-07 10:08:19,Holy shit boston fans quiet
2024-06-07 10:08:26,Imagine if Kyrie wasn't selling.
2024-06-07 10:12:53,"I mean, I get that these foot slides are travels but since when do they ever actually call those?"
2024-06-07 10:13:35,He jumped into Lively... challenge that

2024-06-07 10:14:06,How is that foul on Lively. How is JB ramming his arms into Lively‚Äôs head a shooting foul man
2024-06-07 10:15:20,fouls messed up the mavs momentum big time

2024-06-07 10:21:13,Welcome to ESPN hell my WCF friends‚Ä¶
2024-06-07 10:21:25,Doris Burke is an inappropriate human being
2024-06-07 10:21:54,"Celtics will never fail to embarrass Kyrie. Different team, same result"
2024-06-07 10:21:54,Tim Hardaway Jr always taking shots he has no business taking
2024-06-07 10:22:11,Just me or does the ESPN broadcast kind of suck?
2024-06-07 10:23:13,Terrible performance by everyone not named Luka
2024-06-07 10:23:31,Everybody look out: Tatum has 13 points going into the fourth
2024-06-07 10:30:54,Are the Celtics going to run it back with the same team next year ?
2024-06-07 10:31:22,Going from defending Gobert who has the offense of a paper clip to defending Porzinigis has to be a crazy transition.
2024-06-07 10:31:26,Everyone outside of Luka never got off the bus
2024-06-07 10:31:38,"PJ couldn't be more wide open than that

Again"
2024-06-07 10:32:29,"‚ÄúDoes Luka not have any help in Dallas? When will he join the Lakers?‚Äù

2024-06-07 10:32:37,Kyrie tricked yall man lmaooooooo
2024-06-07 10:33:38,"I know Porzingis is so injury prone but damn he was still such a steal for Boston. What a monster, honestly Celtics in 4 if he stays healthy"
2024-06-07 10:34:24,"Its a shame Boston had no competition and will get dog walked by the WCF winner, well thats what I was told the last 2 weeks at least."
2024-06-07 10:38:26,Game 1 over reactions are hilarious
2024-06-07 10:39:21,Milwaukee trading Jrue was so dumb
2024-06-07 10:39:38,"The talent discrepancy is insane. The shooting numbers will vary throughout the series, but the Celtics have forced Luka to do everything."
2024-06-07 10:39:55,Wizards thank you for Gafford but why did you give them KP?
2024-06-07 10:39:57,"Fuck it, let‚Äôs get Dwight Powell minutes"
2024-06-07 10:40:45,Kyrie being garbage basically sealed this game from the start
2024-06-07 10:41:12,"This is going to be an enjoyable series either way, but it would've been really interesting to see The Nuggets go against this Celtics All-Star team."
2024-06-07 10:41:15,Horford so much better at basketball than Kevin Love
2024-06-07 10:46:04,"Game 1 takeaways: 
- KP looks like a well rested player  
- Celtics are deeper than Mavs. They can afford an off game from Tatum, Mavs couldn‚Äôt survive an off game from Kyrie  
- Luka showed up to play, too bad the rest of the team let him down"
2024-06-07 10:49:48,4 white guys on the court what are we at a Duke game?
2024-06-07 10:51:09,Celtics now 5-0 when Tatum shoots below 40% in these playoffs
2024-06-07 10:51:28,I want that Bill Walton shirt. Can't find it anywhere online.
2024-06-07 10:51:55,Luke Kornet with a career year. He‚Äôs not giving shit up.
2024-06-07 10:55:27,we had to wait 9 days for game 1 and now we wait 3 days in between every game. genius scheduling! way to keep momentum!
2024-06-07 10:57:29,Tingus Pingus Finals MVP
2024-06-07 10:59:43,"Celtics switch so well and adapt so quickly on defense it's hard for the Mavs to rely on Luka for complete offensive generation like they're used to. He'll get his, but it's going to be harder for him to facilitate."

J.J. Redick - üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
2024-06-07 09:34:57,it's time to overreact because that level of hubris has never harmed anyone these playoffs
2024-06-07 09:37:00,"Let's be real, this game is a once in a lifetime performance for Porzingis, once he comes back down to earth, and Kyrie gets going, and PJ Washington starts hitting 3s again, then I can easily see the Celtics winning in 5 instead of 4"
